## üåç Overview
GPT-RPG System is a modular, AI-powered role-playing game framework designed to support:
- **Emergent NPC behavior** with memory-based social interactions
- **Dynamic world-building** that reacts to player actions
- **Adaptive storytelling** with procedurally generated encounters
- **Flexible RPG mechanics** supporting multiple genres (ARPG, Strategy, Narrative)

## üîß How the Modular System Works
GPT-RPG operates with **mountable and unmountable modules**, ensuring lightweight execution while allowing deep customization.

### üõ†Ô∏è Available Modules:
| Module Name          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **NPC AI System**     | NPCs have memory layers, faction tags, and personality traits |
| **World Simulation**  | Dynamic weather, seasonal events, and civilization growth |
| **Combat Engine**     | Tactical turn-based combat with procedurally generated encounters |
| **Economy Module**    | Trade systems, taxes, tariffs, and market fluctuations |
| **Magic & Abilities** | Customizable magic systems with unique class-based interactions |

To **enable or disable a module**, use:
```sh
python3 gpt_rpg_installer.py --enable "Combat Engine"
python3 gpt_rpg_installer.py --disable "Economy Module"

## Gameplay Mechanics
Character Creation
Characters evolve dynamically based on player choices and world events.
No rigid class system‚Äîabilities and stats morph as gameplay progresses.
World Interaction
Environments range from single-room encounters to expansive open-world dungeons.
Players can engage with civilizations, negotiate with factions, or wage war.
NPC Behavior & Memory System
NPCs remember player actions and adjust their responses accordingly.
Uses a three-layer memory model for balancing realism and performance.

##Developer Notes & Customization
Adding New Modules
To add a new module:

Create a Python file inside src/modules/
Define the module‚Äôs logic and integrate it with the core engine.
Register it inside gpt_rpg_installer.py for activation.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
class MyCustomModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Custom Magic System"
    
    def activate(self):
        print(f"{self.name} activated!")

    def deactivate(self):
        print(f"{self.name} deactivated!")
